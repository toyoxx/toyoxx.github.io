Abstract
:	We propose a new walking support robot concept, “Nimbus Guardian,” designed to enhance the mobility of both healthy and frail elderly individuals who can walk independently. The proposed robot differs from traditional walker-type or cane-type aids by offering adaptive, minimal touch support based on the user's walking dynamics. Our goal is to realize versatile touch to the user as a preliminary study for developing the adaptive touch walking support robot. To achieve this, we have established a categorization system for walking support touch, outlining the specific types of assistance required for our robot. Based on these categorization, we have developed a prototype that improves the versatility of touch support (touch point, force, and initiator), adapting to the user's body. Our prototype is equipped to offer multiple touch support parts, adjusting to the user's physique. For versatile touch capabilities, we designed a motion control algorithm that includes a controller which directs the robot's wheel movements according to the chosen support points, and a state machine that provides multiple arm placements and movements. We have experimentally implemented this motion control algorithm in our prototype. Through experiments, we verified the touch versatility and discussed the prototype's utility and potential for further development.
