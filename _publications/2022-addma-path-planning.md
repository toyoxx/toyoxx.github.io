Abstract
:	Recently, 3D printers using continuous carbon fiber have attracted attention because of their high mechanical properties and ability to reproduce complex shapes. However, printing complex geometries with continuous fibers typically requires repeatedly cutting the filament. This study proposes a path-planning algorithm for an FDM 3D printer using filaments reinforced with continuous fiber bundles. The method generates a single-stroke path for each layer without cutting the filament by constructing an Eulerian graph from the print pattern and applying Hierholzer's algorithm with constraints. The generated paths were visualized to confirm non-interference, and printed samples were examined using X-ray CT. The results show that gaps during printing can be reduced by parameter adjustment, and the method can be extended to variable wall thickness geometries and aperiodic patterns using Voronoi diagrams.
