Abstract
:	This paper introduces ROS 4 Healthcare (ROS4HC), an open-source ROS2 framework designed to standardize integration of human sensing data into robotic systems for social, assistive, rehabilitation, and medical robotics. The framework provides unified message types, sensor drivers, processing libraries, and visualization tools for physiological, biological, and physical signals. The paper demonstrates practical utility through healthcare robotics case studies such as heart-rate-adaptive wheelchair velocity modulation, an autonomous robotic treadmill, and a nocturnal monitoring system, and discusses how the same architecture generalizes to other domains including industrial safety, human-robot collaboration, and performance monitoring.
