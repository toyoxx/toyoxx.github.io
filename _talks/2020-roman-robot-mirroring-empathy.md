Paper Abstract
:	Self-tracking aims to improve awareness and reduce undesired behaviors, but poorly designed feedback can produce the opposite effect. This work proposes a wearable pet-like robot that mirrors the user's affective state through visual and haptic feedback, encouraging empathy and supportive behaviors toward the artificial agent as an indirect form of self-support. A wearable prototype was developed and evaluated in three user studies to assess the proposed affective representations. The results informed design guidelines for future robot-mirroring wearables, emphasizing physical embodiment, interoceptive feedback, and customization.
