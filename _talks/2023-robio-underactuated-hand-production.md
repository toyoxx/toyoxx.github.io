Paper Abstract
:	The automation of garment manufacturing has been intensified due to labor shortages and amplified production needs. The handling and manipulation of fabric alone consume nearly 80% of the total production line time. Hence, there is a significant research focus on developing specialized grippers for fabric handling. This paper discusses the design of an under-actuated robotic hand tailored to efficiently handle garments and perform post-production tasks, such as integration into ironing or screen-printing machines. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments simulating the task of placing garments onto a rectangular plate, akin to a screen-printing machine, were conducted.
