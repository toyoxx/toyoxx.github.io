Paper Abstract
:	This paper introduces a navigation system that leverages both topological and metric information, enhanced by the integration of semantic features for service robots operating in indoor environments. The system is designed to improve the autonomy, efficiency, and adaptability of service robots in dynamic and partially known environments. The proposed navigation framework combines topological maps, which provide a simplified, abstract representation of the environment, with metric maps that offer detailed spatial information. This hybrid approach allows robots to plan routes on a topological level for large-scale navigation while utilizing metric precision for local maneuvering and obstacle avoidance. We also integrate semantic features into this topo-metric framework for enhanced navigation. By recognizing and understanding semantic elements of the environment-such as places and objects, the robot can make informed decisions and enhance the ability to perform task effectively.
