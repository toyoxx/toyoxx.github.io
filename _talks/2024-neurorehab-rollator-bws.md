Paper Abstract
:	Locomotion-focused neural rehabilitation often requires substantial therapist effort or expensive robotic support for body-weight assistance and pelvis movement. This work summarizes a detachable body-weight-support rollator equipped with wearable sensors to facilitate overground gait training with minimal motion compensation. The system combines instrumented shoes and harnesses to capture gait performance in real time and uses multiple control strategies for users with different mobility levels. Usability was validated in experiments with able-bodied subjects, and the authors discuss future work toward long-term clinical studies with people with neurological disabilities.
