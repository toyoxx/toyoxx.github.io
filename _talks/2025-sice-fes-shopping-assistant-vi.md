Paper Abstract
:	Shopping plays a significant role in shaping consumer identity and social integration. However, for individuals with visual impairments, navigating in supermarkets and identifying products can be an overwhelming and challenging experience. This paper presents an AI-based shopping assistant prototype designed to enhance the autonomy and inclusivity of visually impaired individuals in supermarket environments. The system integrates multiple technologies, including computer vision, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and indoor navigation, into a single, user-friendly platform. Using cameras for ArUco marker detection and real-time environmental scanning, the system helps users navigate the store, identify product locations, provide real-time auditory guidance, and gain context about their surroundings. The assistant interacts with the user through voice commands and multimodal feedback, promoting a more dynamic and engaging shopping experience. The system was evaluated through experiments, which demonstrated its ability to guide users effectively and improve their shopping experience. This paper contributes to the development of inclusive AI-driven assistive technologies aimed at enhancing accessibility and user independence for the shopping experience.
