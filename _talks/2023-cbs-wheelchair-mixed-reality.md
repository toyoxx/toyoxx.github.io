Paper Abstract
:	Nowadays, the number of mobility-disabled individuals who rely on a powered wheelchair to move is increasing. They need to be guided to follow a desired route when they are learning sports skills like wheelchair dance. Some systems using mixed-reality technologies to teach them to move around space are proposed. However, these methods still face difficulties in keeping users inside of a designated path. In this paper, we propose a method for teaching powered wheelchair users to follow a specific path by utilizing mixed-reality technology. In this method, we teach users how to move along a desired path by providing visual guidance cues via a head-mounted device or haptic guidance cues via a wearable haptic interface. Moreover, we employ a shared control policy to help users keep inside of the path. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method and to compare results for the two mixed-reality guidance modalities (visual feedback via a head-mounted device and haptic feedback via a haptic interface). The results reveal that the proposed guidance method with the shared control policy could help users follow a desired path with less deviation. We also discovered that users of the head-mounted device have similar results compared to those of the haptic interface.
