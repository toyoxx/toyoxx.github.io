Paper Abstract
:	This research presents a dynamic motion planning method for mobile robots operating in crowded scenarios. We prioritize safe path planning between moving obstacles such as humans for applications in service robots, particularly for human-centered environments where the robot needs to handle the uncertainty of the moving obstacles. The moving obstacles are tracked online using the sensor onboard the robot and exhibit social navigation behavior utilized by the robot to ascertain the safest path between the moving entities. When planning, the traverse path is calculated to keep a safe distance from the moving person. For this test study, we present the results in the simulation environment and show that the performance of the proposed method can find dynamic paths in such environments.
