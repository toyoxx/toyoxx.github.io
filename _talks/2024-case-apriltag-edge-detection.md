Paper Abstract
:	Most current industrial manipulators are commonly utilized to execute repeated tasks, in which changes in the task require programming of the robot which can be time-consuming. To address this, we provide a method that relays the positional information of the assembly goal position in real-time to a manipulator robot to allow for an assembly process in a variable environment. Our method utilizes AprilTag markers and an edge detection system for high precision location of the assembly goal position in the workspace via sensor integration of 4 RGB cameras. The method also incorporates human-robot interaction mechanism in the form of a digital twin, created in an Isaac Sim environment, to allow for error checking and increase in safety.
