Paper Abstract
:	This paper introduces the \"Adaptable AI-enabled Robots to Create a Vibrant Society\" project, part of Japan's Moonshot R&D Program, and presents CARE (Cooperation of AI-Robot Enablers) as a framework for improving productivity in nursing care. It also discusses the importance of education and training for successful adoption of advanced technologies and proposes an AR-glasses-based nursing care motion guidance system to help non-expert caregivers learn appropriate care techniques.
