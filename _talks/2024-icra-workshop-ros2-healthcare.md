Paper Abstract
:	This workshop paper introduces the ROS 2 Healthcare (ROS2HC) framework and its goal of closing the loop between robotic interventions and physiological human sensing in social, assistive, rehabilitation, and medical robotics. It presents standard interfaces for common wearable sensors, an initial set of ROS 2 drivers, and a broader framework that integrates sensing, state estimation, AI nodes, and tools for logging and visualization. The work emphasizes support for both developers and clinical end users, and highlights applications across robots such as wheelchairs, robotic beds, and therapy devices.
