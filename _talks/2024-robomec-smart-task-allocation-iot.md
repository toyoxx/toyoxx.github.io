Paper Abstract
:	In nations like Japan, where demographic shifts strain healthcare systems, the potential of Robotics and AI to support the aging population is crucial. Yet, despite progress in assistive robotics, their application in real-world home care settings is limited. This paper proposes a novel approach to utilize a network of caregiving robots, which intelligently shares tasks to enhance efficiency while reducing the necessity for human intervention. Through integrating a wide range of sensors in an IoT framework, this system enables unobtrusive device operation and simplifies user interaction through voice commands or touch-based interfaces like smart speakers and apps. The system intelligently assigns tasks to the suitable robot, taking into account the user’s health status. Our priority is safety and fostering independence, with the system gathering ongoing data to progressively increase user self-reliance. We conducted experiments in a cutting-edge living lab at Tohoku University, creating a mock-up of a tech-enhanced care facility. Our system’s compatibility with the Robot Operating System (ROS) enhances its flexibility, allowing for easy integration of new robots and sensors, as well as enabling remote supervision. Our trials show that this model is efficient and flexible for everyday use, demonstrating how robotic systems, supported by IoT, can improve the execution of daily tasks in a smart living setup. This work contributes to the Japan Science and Technology Agency’s Moonshot R&D program, which seeks to leverage robotics and AI to foster a dynamic society by 2050.
