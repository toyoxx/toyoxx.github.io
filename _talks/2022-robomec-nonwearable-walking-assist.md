Paper Abstract
:	In this research, we propose a novel lightweight and compact walking-assist robot to prevent users from falling accidents. We propose the concept for a new walking assist robot. A two-legged wheeled balancing robot is developed to follow the user’s walking motion based on the concept. Each leg consists of a two-link structure, including one driving wheel and two revolute joints. A base frame was connected by the base of both links. Three basic controllers were developed to keep the base frame at a specific angle, change the robot’s overall height and keep the robot’s balance for moving. We utilize a motion capture system called VIVE to keep the specific distance between humans and robots. The validation experiment shows that the proposed robot can follow user’s walking while keeping balance simultaneously.
