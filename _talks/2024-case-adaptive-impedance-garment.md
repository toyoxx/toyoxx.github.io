Paper Abstract
:	This study introduces a new force-position impedance control strategy tailored for robotic systems engaged in the manipulation of elastic garments. Our approach is innovative for incorporating external force and impedance control within an incremental trajectory generation framework. This method allows for dynamic adjustment to prevent over-deformation and potential damage during garment handling, enabling the fabric to deform to desired states and follow intended trajectory trends without compromising textile integrity. By utilizing external forces in an adaptive, incremental manner, we offer a nuanced solution for precise garment manipulation. Our strategy demonstrates the feasibility of detailed manipulation tasks in industrial settings, bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world operations. This effort underscores the importance of automation in enhancing textile handling processes, focusing on practical applications rather than theoretical advancements.
