Paper Abstract
:	Recent advancements in medical science and technology have led to a remarkable increase in the lifespan of the global elderly population. However, this demographic often struggles with mobility issues, leading to a sedentary lifestyle fueled by concerns over their physical capabilities. Traditional treadmill gait training, although beneficial, often becomes monotonous and lacks the real-world feedback necessary for engaging and effective rehabilitation. Addressing this gap, research into virtual walking systems utilizing avatar robots has gained traction. Despite the progress, several challenges remain where the systems prioritize visual feedback without considering the crucial need for alerting users to potential dangers and obstacles. This lack of comprehensive environmental awareness and feedback undermines both user engagement and safety. To address this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm that employs B-splines for precise free space detection, integrated with a safety stop mechanism for an avatar robot. This novel approach enhances user awareness of their surroundings through a sophisticated Graphic User Interface (GUI) that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology. By superimposing free space boundaries and warning messages directly onto a real-time camera feed, the system provides an intuitive and immersive navigation aid. The efficacy of our proposed GUI was rigorously tested across a series of realistic scenarios, comparing teleoperation control performance with and without the augmented interface. Our findings reveal that our GUI markedly enhances user safety and navigational effectiveness, fostering a deeper understanding of and interaction with the surrounding environment, thereby redefining user experience in virtual mobility assistance.
