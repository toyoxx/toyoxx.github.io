Paper Abstract
:	With the growing shortage of caregivers, the demand for independent support technologies is increasing. Yorisoi Robot, a rail-guided assistive device, helps individuals with walking disabilities lead independent lives by mitigating fall impacts without restricting body movement. However, it requires manual transportation by caregivers before use, which may prevent users from accessing Yorisoi Robot independently. In this study, we propose an autonomous transport robot that delivers Yorisoi Robot to users, enabling access without the need for caregiver manual transportation. Experimental results demonstrated that the system successfully delivered Yorisoi Robot under various conditions.
