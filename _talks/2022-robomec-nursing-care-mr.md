Paper Abstract
:	We propose a novel system for teaching nursing care movements using mixed reality technology and human pose estimation technology. This paper proposes a teaching system that guides a patient from a lying posture to a sitting posture. This nursing care operation is not easy to learn because it requires several steps to guide the patient to an appropriate posture. In this method, a mixed reality headset is attached to the caregiver, and “how-to guide the patient” is projected onto the real world to teach the caregiving operation intuitively. The system uses a camera mounted above the patient’s bed to estimate the patient’s pose and then uses a mixed reality headset mounted on the caregiver to project nursing care instructions based on the patient’s pose.
