Paper Abstract
:	Sleep disorders affect one-third of the general population, with prevalence significantly increasing among the elderly. Rocking beds utilizing vestibular stimulation have shown promise as non-pharmaceutical interventions for improving sleep quality. However, existing designs lack the necessary features for retirement facilities, such as protective handles and reclining backrests, limiting their accessibility for elderly individuals who often experience markedly reduced sleep quality. In this work, we introduce Somnomat Care, an evolution of the long-running Somnomat sleep intervention project. While Somnomat Casa was designed for home use, Somnomat Care extends this concept to nursing homes and clinical environments, offering hospital-style functionality. Key enhancements include adjustable headrests, leg rests, and safety side rails, ensuring usability and safety for elderly residents. Preliminary feasibility testing with Somnomat Care demonstrated its viability and ease of integration into elderly care facilities or nursing homes. Combining innovative sleep robotics with tailored design for vulnerable populations, the newly designed robotic bed aims to enhance sleep quality, improving overall health and well-being in institutionalized elderly individuals. Future studies will validate its efficacy and assess long-term benefits, positioning Somnomat Care as a practical tool for improving sleep in geriatric care environments.
