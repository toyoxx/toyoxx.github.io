Paper Abstract
:	With the development of robotics, people contrive to use robot manipulators to deal with many industrial tasks and daily missions. However, the manipulators still face challenges in dynamic environments, especially when this environment involves dealing with deformable objects like picking up one T-shirt from a stack of clothes or arranging a cable from messy wiring. To manipulate the deformable objectives, many researchers proposed two main methods, data-driven approaches and human-involved approaches. Human-involved methods are more universal to all environments, where data-driven approaches might not be useful if they were not trained in this environment. In terms of human-involved methods, up to now, most of the methods can achieve tasks with fixed human-robot interaction, like humans handling the manipulators to move some objects. During this task, without human motion, the manipulators won’t move. The fixed human-robot interaction way limits the robustness of the system to achieve tasks when some disturbances occur. In this paper, we proposed a novel human-involved manipulator control paradigm, this paradigm allows both users and manipulators can smoothly change their interaction ways based on the tasks processing and environments’ changes. Using this method, persons collaborate with manipulators only at the necessary timing, like when the task almost fails and needs persons to intervene to correct this error. When the task goes well, the person and manipulator do their task. All the human-robot interaction modes will be adaptive switched by the system automatically.
