Paper Abstract
:	In this research, we propose a novel autonomous mobile robot for transporting passive welfare objects in medical facilities. To actuate the robot, together with a welfare object, a differential wheeled robot is developed. Additionally, to combine the robot with various types of welfare objects safely, the robot can adjust its geometrical shape in the vertical direction by using a mechanism called zip chain actuator. When considering the task of transporting a welfare object, the robot must localize itself properly and detect the environmental information continuously. Furthermore, the robot must be able to handle the payload of such combined objects. To achieve this, we implement a Move Base Interface, where various kinds of sensory information including the data of IMU, wheel encoder and laser scanners are fused by using a localization algorithm called Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL). In addition, the direction towards the robot moves is reversed during the transportation task, so that it is possible to pull the object and maintain localization simultaneously. Through experimental validation, we confirmed that the proposed mobile robot can follow the local planner trajectory ideally and reached the destination regardless the partial occlusion and unknow dynamics of passive objects.
